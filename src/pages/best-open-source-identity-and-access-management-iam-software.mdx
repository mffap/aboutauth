# Best Open Source Identity & Access Management Solutions in 2025

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is critical for security and user experience.
For developers, adopting an Open Source (OSS) solution for IAM isn't just about saving license fees - it's about trust and control.

IAM is a sensitive layer of your security architecture and Open Source and an open source solution can provide many benefits, such as: 

**Transparent Code:** The logic that authenticates your users, stores and handles sensitive information about your users, and integrates with other tools is open for inspection. This allows security experts and your own team to audit it, reducing the risk of backdoors or undisclosed vulnerabilities found in proprietary opaque solutions.

**Transparent Build-Process:** Most open source solutions, besides the software's code, publish the build process and the artifacts. This allows users and researchers to validate that the software was built from the open source code, further reducing the risk of backdoors and vulnerabilities.

**Control Over Data:** You control the deployment and where your data is being stored and processed. If the vendor changes its pricing or strategy, you have the freedom to change the provider.

:::note Understanding Open Source Licenses & Business Models

When choosing an open-source product, the license dictates your legal rights and obligations. Users must look out for the distinction between Permissive (like MIT, Apache 2.0) and Copyleft (like GPL, AGPL) licenses.

* **Permissive Licenses** (e.g., Apache 2.0, BSD-3-Clause) are very liberal, typically allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the software for any purpose, without having to release your own source code.
* **Copyleft Licenses** (e.g., AGPLv3) are stricter; they require that if you modify the software and run it as a service over a network, you must make the source code of your modifications available to the public. For identity infrastructure, this is a critical consideration if you plan to build proprietary features on top of the core.

There are several commercial open source business models. Commercial providers employ might employ a combination of the following models, even in addition to other revenue generating strategies:

* **Open Core** where the basic product is OSS, but advanced, enterprise-needed features (like SAML or premium connectors) are available only under a separate commercial license. Always check which features are truly open source under the main license.
* **Services** where the vendor offers professional such as technical support or consulting as part of an ongoing agreement.
* **Hosting** where the company provides a hosted, managed version as software-as-a-service (SaaS). Customers pay for the convenience and support of a hosted solution.

## Choosing an Open Source IAM Solution

When selecting an open source IAM solution, developers should look for:

1. **Protocol Support**: Standards-compliant support for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), SAML, SCIM, and more.

1. **Scalability & Architecture**: Designed for cloud-native deployment (Docker, Kubernetes/Helm), high-availability setups, and zero-downtime upgrades. The underlying technology (language, database support) should align with your enterprise environment.

1. **Extensibility**: Clear and complete APIs, webhooks, and features for custom logic, integration with third-party services, and customization and branding of user-facing flows.

1. **Community & Support:** An active community (eg, GitHub, Discord, forums) for troubleshooting, along with a clearly defined path to professional or enterprise support with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

1. **Licensing & Commercial Model:** License and contractual terms that align with how you intend to use the software and compliant to your company's policies, and a commercial model that doesn't hinder your future growth.

## Conclusion: When to Choose Which Open Source IAM Solution

Choosing the right OSS IAM is about matching the tool's core strength to your business needs:

* **For Enterprise Federation:** Choose **Keycloak**. Its deep feature set and maturity make it the most reliable hub for aggregating existing corporate identities (AD/LDAP).
* **For B2B SaaS:** Choose **Zitadel**. Its native multi-tenancy model simplifies the architecture required to give each customer their own isolated IDP.
* **For Custom CIAM:** Choose **Ory Kratos** or **Supertokens**. Kratos if you want a headless API for total UI control; Supertokens if you want an easier integration with pre-built UI components and SDKs.
* **For Internal IT/Proxy Security:** Choose **Authentik** for a feature-rich reverse proxy solution, or **Authelia** for the most lightweight and simple deployment behind a single reverse proxy.
