### List of IAM Tools on AboutAuth

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial aspect of modern software development, covering everything from simple user authentication to complex access control policies. Here are some of the platforms we've discussed:

* **Auth0**: A developer-focused platform that offers a wide range of authentication and authorization features. It's known for its extensibility and SDKs, making it a popular choice for building customer-facing applications. Auth0 was acquired by Okta, but continues to be a major player in the space.
* **AWS Cognito**: A fully managed service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides user authentication, sign-up, sign-in, and access control for web and mobile apps. It is a natural choice for applications already running on AWS due to its deep integration with the wider AWS ecosystem.
* **Curity**: An identity server that is focused on API security and standards-compliance. It is a good choice for organizations that require a highly configurable and secure solution for complex B2B and B2C use cases.
* **FusionAuth**: A modern, self-hosted or cloud-based customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform. It offers a rich feature set, including SSO, MFA, and powerful APIs, with a focus on flexibility and low cost for developers. FusionAuth is often a strong alternative for teams who need a self-managed solution that is simpler to operate than some open-source alternatives.
* **Keycloak**: An open-source IAM solution that provides features like SSO, user federation, and social login. Keycloak is a powerful, self-hosted option for developers who need more control over their identity stack.
* **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)**: Microsoft's cloud-based IAM service. It's deeply integrated with the Microsoft ecosystem, including Microsoft 365 and Azure, and is a strong choice for organizations standardized on Microsoft products.
* **Okta**: A leading IAM provider with solutions for both workforce and customer identity. Okta is a robust, enterprise-grade platform that offers single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and a large number of pre-built integrations.
* **Ping Identity**: An identity security platform that offers a modular approach to IAM. It provides solutions for SSO, MFA, and API security, and is a veteran in the identity space.
* **WorkOS**: A platform for adding enterprise-level features to your application. It provides B2B-specific identity features like SAML SSO, SCIM user provisioning, and Directory Sync. WorkOS is designed for developers who need to sell their product to larger companies that require these complex integrations with their corporate identity providers.
* **Zitadel**: An open-source, cloud-native identity infrastructure platform that simplifies B2B and B2C use cases. It is known for its multi-tenancy capabilities and API-first approach, making it an excellent choice for developers building modern applications that require fine-grained access control and self-service for their customers.
