# Single Sign-On (SSO)

## SAML vs. SSO: What's the Difference?

While often used interchangeably, SAML and SSO are not the same:

SSO: Single sign-on is the overarching concept of using one set of credentials to access multiple applications.
SAML: SAML is a specific protocol that enables SSO. It's the engine under the hood that makes SSO possible in many scenarios.
Think of it like this: SSO is the destination (seamless access), and SAML is one of the roads (protocols) to get there.
