# Learn About Auth

## OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. It enables clients to verify an end-user's identity using an authorization server and to get basic user profile information. OIDC uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) called the ID Token to securely transfer claims about the user, simplifying single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity.
