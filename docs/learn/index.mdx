This section is designed to provide clear, concise explanations and practical insights into the world of authentication and authorization, helping you build secure and user-friendly applications.

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. It's the backbone of modern single sign-on (SSO) solutions.
